# Mango Leaf Disease_Image_classifier

Implemented image classifier model using Machine learning models such as Convolution Neural Network (CNN),Gausian Naive Bayes, kNN Classifier, Random Forest Classifier and Decision Tree Classifier.

### Libraries Used 
The following libraries are used in this code:
NumPy, TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas, Seaborn, PyLab, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

### Code Execution 
To execute the code, simply run it in a Python environment with the required libraries installed.

The code imports a image files, applies some preprocessing to the data, and splits the data into training, validation, and test sets. Various kinds of models has been trained on the training set, which is evaluated using the validation set. Finally, the performance of the models is evaluated on the test set, and a bar graph is generated to visualize the results.

### Dataset
 -> Type of data: 240x320 mango leaf images. <br>
 -> Data format: JPG. <br>
 -> Number of images: 4000 images. Of these, around 1800 are of distinct leaves, and the rest are prepared by zooming and rotating where deemed necessary.<br>
 -> Diseases considered: Seven diseases, namely Anthracnose, Bacterial Canker, Cutting Weevil, Die Back, Gall Midge, Powdery Mildew, and Sooty Mould.<br>
 -> Number of classes: Eight (including the healthy category).<br>
 -> Distribution of instances: Each of the eight categories contains 500 images.<br>
